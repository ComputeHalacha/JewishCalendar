### How do I get set up? ###

In the repository, there are 8  projects.

1. ***\JewishCalendar\JewishCalendar.csproj***    
    The code for the JewishCalendar .NET library. Compiles to **JewishCalendar.dll**.  
    This is a stand-alone project. It does not reference any other project in this repository. 

1. ***\LuachProject\LuachProject\LuachProject.csproj***     
	Creates **LuachProject.exe**.  
	This is the main "Luach Project" Windows application with the full functionality.  
	This project references *JewishCalendar.dll*, JewishDatePicker.dll* and *OmerReminder.exe*. 
	
1. ***\LuachMobile\LuachMobile\***  
	This folder contains both jCal.js and The Luach Project Mobile app project. 
	
	The project can be opened and compliled to native mobile apps using Microsoft Visual Studio with the project ***\LuachMobile\LuachMobile\LuachMobile.jsproj***.   
	This is Visual Studio Javascript Apache Cordova project.  
	As such, it requires that the **Javascript Apache Cordova Apps** project type is installed in Visual Studio.  
	Additionally, the project requires that the [Bundler & Minifier Extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9ec27da7-e24b-4d56-8064-fd7e88ac1c40)  be installed to group and minify the javascript and CSS files together. 
	
	The project can also be opened and compiled using [IntelÂ® XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-xdk) with the project file ***\LuachMobile\LuachMobile\LuachMobile.xdk***.  
   
	Intels XDK has a few advantages over Visual Studio in that:
	* 	You can test on IOS without an OSX computer or an Apple Developer Account by using the XDK IOS app.  
		In VS, you can only install on an IOS devive for testing if you have a computer running OSX and an Apple Developer Account (cost $99 a year). 
	* 	The XDK emulator tools are much easier to work with. 
	* 	Cross platform development. The XDK has versions for Windows, Mac and Linux.
	
  	On the other hand, code editing and debugging is somewhat smoother in VS and all the js/css minifying and bundling is taken care of for you automatically with the [Bundler & Minifier Extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9ec27da7-e24b-4d56-8064-fd7e88ac1c40).
	
1. ***\JewishDatePicker\JewishDatePicker.cs***    
	 The code for the **JewishDatePicker.dll**.    
	 This is a windows forms control for picking Jewish dates (Similar to the regular DateTimePicker control.). This project references the  *JewishCalendar.dll*. 
	 
1. ***\Luach\Luach.csproj***    
	Creates **Luach.exe** - A watered down version of The Luach Project application.   
	Is included mainly to demonstrate how to use the JewishCalendar objects.  
	This project references both *JewishCalendar.dll* and *JewishDatePicker.dll*. 
	
1. ***\LuachProject\OmerReminders\OmerReminders.vbproj***    
	Creates **OmerReminder.exe**.  
	This Windows application creates daily Windows tasks and Outlook reminders to count Sefira.  
	The code was written in vb.net for some reason.  
	This project references *JewishCalendar.dll*. 
	
1. ***\LuachProject\SetupLuachProject\SetupLuachProject.vdproj***    
	This is a Visual studio installer project for creating a Windows Installer for **The Luach Project** .NET application.  
	This project is dependent on *\LuachMobile\LuachMobile\LuachMobile.jsproj*.  
	**PLEASE NOTE:**  
	A Visual Studio installer project cannot be opened in VS 2013 or VS 2015 unless you add the [Windows Installer Extention](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f1cc3f3e-c300-40a7-8797-c509fb8933b9)
	
1. ***\JewishCalendar\TestBenchmarks\TestBenchmarks.csproj***    
	A console application for benchmarking.  
	Used primarily to compare the different implementations of the Jewish Date calculations.  
	This project references *JewishCalendar.dll*.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* The code for the libraries are fairly well documented and commented, but the applications are less so. If you find an obvious mistake or bug, please don't hesitate to change. But if you just don't understand the reasoning behind some logic etc., it would be great if I could be contacted (cb@compute.co.il) before changing. There is that minuscule chance that there is a sensible explanation for the weirdness. 
* Tests - yes, please! The project grew in very small increments created as they were needed for other projects - it was never expected to become a full library. Unfortunately, no tests were created.
